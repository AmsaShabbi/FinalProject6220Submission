# FinalProject6220Submission
This semester, as part of my Advanced Statistical Approaches to Quality course, I worked on this project.
This project focuses on predicting diabetes in individuals using machine learning techniques, specifically neural network and logistic regression models. The models are trained on a dataset containing various health-related features, such as pregnancies, insulin level, age, and BMI, sourced from Kaggle. The objective is to develop accurate predictive models to aid in diagnosing diabetes based on diagnostic measurements.

Dataset: The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and originally obtained from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. It comprises records of individuals' health attributes and their diabetes status. The dataset includes features such as pregnancies, insulin level, age, BMI, and a binary indicator for diabetes presence.

Methodology:
Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables if present.
Model Training:
Neural Network: A simple neural network architecture is employed to learn the complex relationships between the input features and the target variable (diabetes presence).
Logistic Regression: Logistic regression, a classical statistical technique, is also utilized to model the probability of diabetes occurrence based on the input features.
Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess their performance in predicting diabetes.
Interpretation: The results obtained from the models are interpreted to understand the significance of various features in predicting diabetes and to identify potential risk factors.
Usage:
To replicate the experiment or explore the models further, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (listed in requirements.txt).
Run the provided Jupyter notebook or Python script to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.
Experiment with different hyperparameters, feature engineering techniques, or model architectures to improve the predictive accuracy.
Interpret the model results and draw insights into the factors influencing diabetes prediction.
Contribution:
Contributions to the project, including bug fixes, enhancements, or additional analyses, are welcome. Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request for review.
