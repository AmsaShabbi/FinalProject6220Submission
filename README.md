# FinalProject6220Submission
This semester, as part of my Advanced Statistical Approaches to Quality course, I worked on this project.
The objective is to employ various features such as Pregnancies, Insulin Level, Age, and BMI to predict whether an individual has diabetes.
The dataset I'm using is sourced from Kaggle, originally acquired from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Its purpose is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes based on specific diagnostic measurements.
The dataset consists of female patients aged at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage, selected under specific criteria from a larger database. 
For my project, I've implemented a simple neural network alongside logistic regression in my code.
